      <p>Based in Belfast, noise guaranteed is a collective effort to encourage and nuture critical perspectives on music technology. Together we learn through our practice of building electronic tools for music making.</p>
      <p>Why do we call ourselves noise guaranteed? If there's one thing we can guarantee in our workings, writings and speech, it's noise. In fact we want to make and embrace noise. We want to question the origins of the technology we use. We're not scientists, engineers or ethicists in the traditional sense. We are not formally trained in these disciplines. However, we have a right to question from a position of naivety. Our view from afar, our view from below will mature and our questions will refine.</p>
      <p>Noise is everywhere; electromagnetic radiation, the hum, hiss and rumble of transportation; our internal fog of ideas, thoughts and feelings, and the messy ways in which these are often articulated. Noise is part of the human experience, let us embrace it, stand on its shoulders and move beyond.</p>
